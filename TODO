there may be slight inaccuracy, the solution should be

.container > *:first-child
instead of
.container p:first-child

since we should match only first element in a container, but when we do " " combinator, it will match all choldren recursively. That means if there is a paragraph that is a child of a child of container, it will be the first child (not of container, but of child of container) and will be matched. E.G.


<div class="container">
  <p>
  we match this (expected)
  </p>
  <p>
    we do not match this
  </p>
  <article>
    <p>
      we match this (unexpected)
    </p>
  </article>
</div>

scratch that, Task4 already checks ">", and its only tasks, so its not such big of a deal.

Table styling quick tips

Before moving on, we thought we'd provide you with a quick list of the most useful points illustrated above:

    Make your table markup as simple as possible, and keep things flexible.
    Use table-layout: fixed to create a more predictable table layout that allows you to easily set column widths by setting width on their headings (<th>).
    Use border-collapse: collapse to make table elements borders collapse into each other, producing a neater and easier to control look.
    Use <thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot> to break up your table into logical chunks and provide extra places to apply CSS to, so it is easier to layer styles on top of one another if required.
    Use zebra striping to make alternative rows easier to read.
    Use text-align to line up your <th> and <td> text, to make things neater and easier to follow.
```

In the rendered DOM the browser may have normalized the HTML, for example by correcting some badly-written HTML for you. If you incorrectly closed an element, for instance by opening an <h2> but closing with an </h3>, the browser will figure out what you were meaning to do and the HTML in the DOM will correctly close the open <h2> with an </h2>.
```
AHAHHAHAHAHAH I CAN'T, WHAT??!?!?!??!
