<h1>Bobon4uto (pronounced bobonchito)</h1>
<h2>Nick origign</h2>
<p>
My real name is <i>Vladimir</i>. The nickname was actually supposed to be Vovanchito, coming from <i>"Vovan"</i>, which is a variation of my name.
But with time it transformed. First iteration, I think, was BoBoH4Nto.
</p>
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>
I study at NSTU (Novosibirsk State Technical University), don't know how much I should say, but that place is pretty cool.
Even in USSR when a lot of things were not allowed, they played Jazz, despite it being banned. Obviously I wasn't there, so I cannot prove it.
But I was on the performance they made not long ago, and they played "pink panther".
</p><p>
Regarding my studies in here, I first went to a Faculty where chemistry was mandatory, and kind of got scared to death when acid exploded one day.
Still, I wasn't sure if I wanted to leave. But then I joined a student brigade that worked as conductors on Novosibirsk-Adler train route.
And in here I literally had a breakdown because I realised I didn't wanna work here, I didn't wanna study, I felt really bad and cried.
Thankfully, my supervisor comforted me, we talked about many things and she suggested me changing things if I didn't like how they are.
That was a revalation, because I never thought that I can do ... <b>ANYTHING</b>. I didn't have to finish work contract,
I can bail out (well, I still had to finish one race, otherwise I wouldn't get home, obviously). And I didn't have to study on that faculty.
So, I changed faculties, at first I thought none would accept me, but it was the opposite - seeing my results on this faculty,
others were really happy to accept me. That's how I got into AVTF.

<h2>Scope of interest</h2>
<p>
There are a lot of things I'm interested in. Games, Music, CODING, Books, Anime(bruh), text RP.
<h3>Books</h3>
I wouldn't say I read a lot of books. I just buy them sometimes and read from time to time. Last time I was in a book store,
one book fell from the shelf when I was searching for another one. I felt obligated to buy that book (it was Tisato Abe's "Crow's secret"
[I'm translating the name from russian so the actual name might be different]) It's a good book, but the premise is questionable.
<h3>Games</h3>
I'm not a huge fan of AAA games, in fact, I haven't played in any AAA games from 2020+.
(wait, does Baldur's gate 3 count? Well, I only bought it, haven't played it yet, so it doesn't matter)
I'm more interested in Indie games, and making my own, or modding.
You can tell this is true by the amount of my repositories that are related to gaming (most of them are)
My favorite game is "Outcore", it has such a heart-warming message "if you don't like it, change da world"
(It wasn't explicit, but if you played the game you know what I'm talking about)
<h3>Music</h3>
I LOVE Music! Even if I don't know the lyrics. Just the vibe of it is enough. I listened to Vocaloids, rappers, rock, some folk.
Recently I started listening a lot of current Russian rock groups (should I translate them? I will anyway) like
"pygmies", "Infornal ****Ъ", "beaver's brotherhood"
<h3>Anime</h3>
You can't not know about anime today. Some time ago I was locked in and watched a lot of anime (unhealthy amount).
Today not so much. favorite shows are:
"Jojo's Bizzare Adventure", "Don't bully me, Nagotoro", "Demon slayer".
<h3>text RP</h3>
Role-Playing. I know it sounds bad, but its just when you write stories with someone else. Not DnD, since there is no system per say, but similar.
I was always writing some stories, I have a ficbook (it's cringe) and I still have my dairy from school (it's even more cringe).
<h3>Coding</h3>
Obviously, I write code. I wouldn't be on github otherwise. But how do I write it? Depends. Sometimes I want to throw random stuff untill it works,
sometimes I want to perfect one line of code. (former:[my entity component system repo] latter: [my BraveWizardChan repo])
I'm also very stubborn, if I want to do something not like anyone else, I will, then I will realize why no one does it like this
and have to rewrite everything. I also segfaulted Rust (it was when using nativeWindows ui library, pretty sure problem was inside it,
although it still was my mistake that caused a segfault, it's just they probably could've prevented it)
Speaking of languages, my favorites are:
C, lua (I use Neovim btw), scala (it's so cringe sometimes I love it)
I love C macros. And I hate them. They are just not flexible enough. best use i found is this:
<code>

#define FRUITS(T) \
T(APPLE) \
T(ORANGE) \
T(MANGO) \

#define UNROLL_ENUM(X) X,
  typedef enum {
    FRUITS(UNROLL_ENUM)
  } Fruit;
#define UNROLL_PRINT(X) case X: printf(#X); break;
  void print_fruit(Fruit f) {
    switch(f) {
      FRUITS(UNROLL_PRINT)
    }
  }

</code>
And this is cool and all, but when you want to make something like T(X,FORMAT) it becomes macro hell.
Also _Generic is dumb, why does it not dissapear after preprocessing?
</p>
<p>
Lua is great, that's why I like Neovim. Also, my first mod was made in Lua for "Don't starve together"
</p>
<p>
If scala didn't take 10 years and 10 gigs of internet traffic to compile simple hello world, it would be actually the best language ever.
But I guess All that lexical facade increases compiler complexity.
